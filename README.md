# ToDoApp

My ToDoApp allows you to enter and set tasks to remind you of the things that need 
to be done and completed. 

How to use ToDoApp:

In the My Tasks tabs, this is where all your tasks are kept.
Each task contains a title, and the date and time it was added, aswell as
a delete button and a toggle switch to remind you what tasks tou have
already completed and the tasks which are yet to be done.

In the Add New Task tab, this is where you just enter the task that 
you want to remind yourself to do. Type the task into the textbox which says
"Enter a task here" and then click the button "Add to My ToDo List". This then
saves your new task to your list of tasks in the My Tasks tab.
